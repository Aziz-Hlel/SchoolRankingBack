- In most relational DBs (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), a transaction locks data during updates/deletes to ensure consistency

- benefits of @Transactional :
    All operations inside the method succeed or fail together — no partial updates.
    Spring can rollback changes if a method fails, ensuring data consistency.
    Spring optimizes transaction scopes to reduce locking and DB overhead.




- If a method only reads from the DB, use:
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
➕ This helps performance (e.g., disables dirty checking).




- Flushing ≠ Committing
Flushing writes changes to the database, but the transaction is still open; changes can still be rolled back after flushing.
Committing means the transaction ends and changes become permanent.

@Transactional
public void updateSchoolName(UUID schoolId, String newName) {
    School school = schoolRepo.findById(schoolId).orElseThrow();
    school.setName(newName);

    // Changes are tracked but not yet flushed

    // Now, before commit, Hibernate flushes changes:
    // UPDATE school SET name = ? WHERE id = ?

    // Finally, the transaction commits.
}
