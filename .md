

- In most relational DBs (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), a transaction locks data during updates/deletes to ensure consistency

- benefits of @Transactional :
    All operations inside the method succeed or fail together — no partial updates.
    Spring can rollback changes if a method fails, ensuring data consistency.
    Spring optimizes transaction scopes to reduce locking and DB overhead.




- If a method only reads from the DB, use:
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
➕ This helps performance (e.g., disables dirty checking).




- Flushing ≠ Committing
Flushing writes changes to the database, but the transaction is still open; changes can still be rolled back after flushing.
Committing means the transaction ends and changes become permanent.

@Transactional
public void updateSchoolName(UUID schoolId, String newName) {
    School school = schoolRepo.findById(schoolId).orElseThrow();
    school.setName(newName);

    // Changes are tracked but not yet flushed

    // Now, before commit, Hibernate flushes changes:
    // UPDATE school SET name = ? WHERE id = ?

    // Finally, the transaction commits.
}







- Boolean vs boolean :
    // in the DTO level , when validating a request body  and entity level
    boolean is a  Java primitives and can never be null — they default to false if not explicitly set. So:

        When the field is missing or explicitly set to null in the JSON request,

        The deserialization (e.g., via Jackson) sets the field to its default value, which is false for boolean.

        @NotNull doesn’t do anything, because the value is never null — it's just false.
    

    Correct Approach : 
    Use the wrapper type Boolean instead of primitive boolean so that null values are possible, and @NotNull can work as intended:
    
        @NotNull
        private Boolean safetyCompliance;


    the same thing apply in the entity level of JPA So if you want the column to be NOT NULL, use Boolean + @NotNull.
    Best approach(always be explicit anyway wheither it s only true false , or can be nullable, dont use boolean  )
        @Column(nullable = false)
        @NotNull
        private Boolean safetyCompliance;
